#Penetration Testing with Raspberry Pi - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Penetration Testing with Raspberry Pi - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/penetration-testing-raspberry-pi-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787126138), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the command is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 2.



The command will look like the following:
```
xz â€“d kali-2.1.2-rpi2.img.xz
```

We definitely recommend having a Raspberry Pi 3 to be able to practice and implement the concepts and examples we are going to show in this book. We do discuss in Chapter 1, Choosing a Pen Test Platform, how to purchase a Raspberry Pi as well as how to configure the other system components that are required for topics in other chapters.  Additional Bluetooth and Wireless network adapters may be needed as well, and are discussed in their applicable sections.

Kali Linux and the other software applications referenced in this book are open source, meaning they are free to download.  The hardware and software is not required if you are looking to just follow the concepts covered within this book.
